# Email Verification System Documentation

## Overview

The AfricaVLP Laravel applications now include a complete email verification system for both admin and client applications. This system ensures that users verify their email addresses before gaining full access to the platform.

## System Components

### 1. Notification Classes

#### EmailVerificationNotification
- **Location**: `app/Notifications/EmailVerificationNotification.php` (both apps)
- **Features**:
  - Queued notification for better performance
  - Branded email templates with AU VLP styling
  - Custom brand colors (#8A2B13)
  - Configurable expiration time (60 minutes default)
  - Temporary signed URLs for security

### 2. Authentication Controllers

#### Client App AuthController
- **Location**: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthController.php`
- **Methods**:
  - `sendVerificationEmail(User $user)` - Send verification email
  - `resendVerificationEmail(Request $request)` - Resend verification email
  - `verifyEmail(Request $request, $id, $hash)` - Handle email verification
  - `showVerifyEmailForm()` - Show verification notice page

#### Admin App AuthController
- **Location**: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthController.php`
- **Methods**: Same as client app but with admin-specific redirects and messaging

### 3. Routes

#### Client App Routes
```php
// Email Verification Routes
Route::get('/email/verify', [AuthController::class, 'showVerifyEmailForm'])->name('verification.notice');
Route::get('/email/verify/{id}/{hash}', [AuthController::class, 'verifyEmail'])->name('verification.verify');
Route::post('/email/verification-notification', [AuthController::class, 'resendVerificationEmail'])->name('verification.send');
```

#### Admin App Routes
```php
// Email Verification Routes
Route::get('/email/verify', [AuthController::class, 'showVerifyEmailForm'])->name('verification.notice');
Route::get('/email/verify/{id}/{hash}', [AuthController::class, 'verifyEmail'])->name('verification.verify');
Route::post('/email/verification-notification', [AuthController::class, 'resendVerificationEmail'])->name('verification.send');
```

### 4. View Templates

#### Client App
- **Location**: `resources/views/auth/verify-email.blade.php`
- **Features**: User-friendly verification notice with resend functionality

#### Admin App
- **Location**: `resources/views/auth/verify-email.blade.php`
- **Features**: Admin-specific verification notice with security messaging

## Email Verification Flow

### 1. Registration Process
1. User registers on the platform
2. Account created with `status = 'pending'`
3. `email_verification_token` generated and stored
4. Verification email sent automatically
5. User redirected to verification notice page

### 2. Email Verification Process
1. User receives branded verification email
2. User clicks verification link
3. System validates hash and user ID
4. Account status updated to 'active'
5. `email_verified_at` timestamp set
6. `email_verification_token` cleared
7. User automatically logged in
8. Redirected to dashboard

### 3. Resend Verification
1. User can request new verification email
2. System checks if already verified
3. New verification email sent if needed
4. Success/error feedback provided

## Email Service Configuration

The system supports multiple email services:

### SendGrid (Recommended)
```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@africavlp.org
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME="African Universities VLP"
```

### Mailgun (Alternative)
```env
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your_mailgun_domain
MAILGUN_SECRET=your_mailgun_secret
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailgun.org
```

### Standard SMTP (Fallback)
```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
```

## Database Schema

### Users Table Fields
- `email_verified_at` - Timestamp when email was verified
- `email_verification_token` - Token for verification (cleared after verification)
- `status` - User status ('pending', 'active', 'inactive')

## Security Features

### Hash Validation
- Email verification links use SHA1 hash validation
- Hash based on user's email address
- Prevents tampering with verification links

### Temporary URLs
- Verification links expire after 60 minutes
- Uses Laravel's temporary signed routes
- Automatic expiration prevents stale links

### Token-based Security
- Secure verification tokens stored in database
- Tokens cleared after successful verification
- Prevents token reuse

### Rate Limiting
- Built-in protection against spam
- Laravel's default rate limiting applies
- Prevents abuse of resend functionality

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Logging
```php
// Success logging
Log::info('Email verification sent', [
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'email' => $user->email,
    'timestamp' => now()
]);

// Error logging
Log::error('Failed to send email verification', [
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'email' => $user->email,
    'error' => $e->getMessage(),
    'timestamp' => now()
]);
```

### User Feedback

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Emails Not Sending**
   - Check email service configuration
   - Verify API credentials
   - Check queue worker status
   - Review Laravel logs

2. **Verification Links Not Working**

# Check queue status
php artisan queue:work --verbose
```
